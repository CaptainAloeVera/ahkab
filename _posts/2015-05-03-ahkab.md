a SPICE-like electronic circuit simulator written in Python 
-----------------------------------------------------------

The code should be easy to read and modify, the main language is Python -- 2 or 3 -- and it is platform-independent.

## News!

-   Ahkab v0.17 was released on May 17 2015, including new features, many
    bugfixes and improved documentation. It is recommended to upgrade. Check out
    [the release notes](https://github.com/ahkab/ahkab/releases/tag/v0.17) for
    more!
-   The whole codebase has been going through a refactoring and
    documenting effort. It's not complete, yet, but it's improving. Take
    a look at [the new documentation!](http://ahkab.readthedocs.org/)

## Supported simulations:

-   Numeric:
    -   **Operating point**, with guess computation to speed up the
        solution. See example: [Downscaling current
        mirror](http://ahkab.readthedocs.org/en/latest/examples/OP_simulation.html)
    -   **DC sweep**.
    -   **Transient analysis**, available differentiation formulas:
        implicit Euler, trapezoidal, gear orders from 2 to 5. See for
        example the [simulation of a Colpitts
        Oscillator](http://ahkab.readthedocs.org/en/latest/examples/Transient-Example.html).
    -   **AC analysis**.
    -   **Periodic steady state analysis** of non-autonomous circuits,
        *time* *domain* shooting and brute-force algorithms.
    -   **Pole-zero analysis**.
-   Symbolic:
    -   **Small signal analysis**, AC or DC, with extraction of transfer
        functions, DC gain, poles and zeros. Various [symbolic analysis
        examples on this
        page](http://ahkab.readthedocs.org/en/latest/examples/Symbolic-simulation.html).

An experimental `pypy` branch [is available on
Github](https://github.com/ahkab/ahkab/tree/pypy_symbolic) for those who are
mostly interested in the symbolic capabilities of the simulator and raw speed - be sure to install
[numpy for pypy](https://bitbucket.org/pypy/numpy) first!.

## Download and install

That's so easy! Check out the code from Github, or install from a
tarball, or even better get the latest ahkab off PYPI with a single command:

    # pip install ahkab

Notice pip will try to satisfy the dependencies for you. You may want to
install them yourself with your OS package manager before running the
above command. All dependencies are listed in the doc.

## Run standalone

    $ python ahkab -o graph.dat <netlist file>

See `ahkab --help` for command line switches.

## Documentation

The simulator can either be run from the command line with a netlist
file or included in a python script.

Please refer to the
[documentation](http://ahkab.readthedocs.org/), in particular the
[netlist syntax
page](http://ahkab.readthedocs.org/en/latest/help/Netlist-Syntax.html)
for how to write the netlist files that describe the circuit. Experience
with running SPICE or other commercial simulators can be useful.

The latter option is shown briefly in the [Python
API](http://ahkab.readthedocs.org/en/latest/examples/Python_API.html)
doc page.

Have fun! Don't forget to report back cool simulations or any bug may
you run into!

## How this project was born

This project was born when I was an enthusiastic undergrad, apparently
with plenty of free time, attending "Simulazione Circuitale" (*Circuit
Simulation*) taught by [Prof. A.
Brambilla](http://brambilla.dei.polimi.it/) back in Italy at the
Polytechnic University of Milan.

I am grateful to prof. Brambilla for teaching one of the most
interesting courses of my university years. -GV

## Bugs and patches

Note that this project is still far from its 1.0 release. *I may add new
functionality at the expense of breaking stuff*. Most likely I will introduce a
new feature even if that means breaking backwards compatibility a couple of
cases. I apologize about that. 
If you know how to fix the problem and you have a bit of time to spare, you can
send me a pull request or a patch. :)

Does it work? Bugs? Do you have patches? Did you run some noteworthy
simulation? *Let me know!*

- For all your bug-squashing needs, please [file an issue in our bug
  tracker](https://github.com/ahkab/ahkab/issues).
- Feedback is very welcome, my [email address](http://tinymailto.com/5310) is
  available after a captcha.
