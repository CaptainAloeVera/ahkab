Running a modified version of [Jekyll
Clean](https://github.com/scotte/jekyll-clean).

I have modified the CSS and the templates to taste, stripped out Disqus
support, adapted it for a homepage, rather than a blog, and hard-coded a few
parts in the process.

This website includes the following files which are the properties of their
respective owners:

* js/bootstrap.min.js - [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
* css/bootstrap.min.css - [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
* js/jquery.min.js - [jquery](https://jquery.com)
